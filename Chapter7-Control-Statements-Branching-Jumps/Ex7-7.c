/* Programming Exercise 7-7 */

/*
    Write a program that requests the hours worked in a week and then prints the gross pay,
    the taxes, and the net pay. Assume the following:

    a. Basic pay rate = $10.00/hr
    b. Overtime (in excess of 40 hours) = time and a half
    c. Tax rate: #15% of the first $300
    20% of the next $150
    25% of the rest
    Use #define constants, and don't worry if the example does not conform to current
    tax law.

    How many hours your work in a week?
    20
    Your gross pay is $200, your taxes is $30, your net pay is $170.
