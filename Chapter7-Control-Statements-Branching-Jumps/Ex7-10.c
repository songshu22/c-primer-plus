/* Programming Exercise 7-10 */

// The 1998 United States Federal Tax Schedule was the simplest in recent times. It had
// four categories, and each category had two rates. Here is a summary (dollar amounts are
// taxable income):

// Category                           Tax
// Single                             15% of first $17,850 plus 28% of excess
// Head of Household                  15% of first $23,900 plus 28% of excess
// Married, Joint                     15% of first $29,750 plus 28% of excess
// Married, Separate                  15% of first $14,875 plus 28% of excess

// For example, a single wage earner with a taxable income of $20,000 owes 0.15 x $17,850
// + 0.28 x ($20,000-$17,850). Write a program that lets the user specify the tax category
// and the taxable income and that then calculates the tax. Use a loop so that the user can
// enter several tax cases.
