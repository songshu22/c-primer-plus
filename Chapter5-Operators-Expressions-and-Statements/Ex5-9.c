/* Programming Exercise 5-9 */

/*
    Write a program that requests the user to enter a Fahrenheit temperature. The program
    should read the temperature as a type double number and pass it as an argument to
    a user-supplied function called Temperatures(). This function should calculate the
    Celsius equivalent and the Kelvin equivalent and display all three temperatures with a
    precision of two places to the right of the decimal. It should identify each value with the
    temperature scale it represents. Here is the formula for converting Fahrenheit to Celsius:

    Celsius = 5.0 / 9.0 * (Fahrenheit - 32.0)

    The Kelvin scale, commonly used in science, is a scale in which 0 represents absolute
    zero, the lower limit to possible temperatures. Here is the formula for converting Celsius
    to Kelvin:

    Kelvin = Celsius + 273.16

    The Temperatures() function should use const to create symbolic representation of
    the three constants that appear in the conversions. The main() function should use
    a loop to allow the user to enter temperatures repeatedly, stopping when a q or other
    nonnumeric value is entered. Use the fact that scanf() returns the number of items
    read, so it will return 1 if it reads a number, but it won't return 1 if the user enters q. The
    == operator tests for equality, so you can use it to compare the return value of scanf()
    with 1.

void Temperatures(double Fahrenheit);

int main(void) {
    double Fahrenheit;

    printf("Please enter a Fahrenheit temperature: ");
    while (scanf("%lf", &Fahrenheit) == 1) {
        Temperatures(Fahrenheit);
        printf("Please enter a Fahrenheit temperature: ");
    }
    return 0;
}

void Temperatures(double Fahrenheit) {
    const double Celsius = 5.0 / 9.0 * (Fahrenheit - 32.0);
    const double Kelvin = Celsius + 273.16;
    printf("Fahrenheit = %.2lf\n", Fahrenheit);
    printf("Celsius = %.2lf\n", Celsius);
    printf("Kelvin = %.2lf\n", Kelvin);
