/* Programming Exercise 4-5 */

/*
    Write a program that requests the download speed in megabits per second (Mbs) and
    the size of a file in megabytes (MB). The program should calculate the download time
    for the file. Note that in this context one byte is eight bits. Use type float, and use /
    for division. The program should report all three values (download speed, file size, and
    download time) showing two digits to the right of the decimal point, as in the following:

    At 18.12 megabits per second, a file of 2.20 megabytes
    downloads in 0.97 seconds.

*/

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	float Mbs, MB, MBs;
	
	printf("Please enter the download speed in megabits per second:\n");
	scanf("%f", &Mbs);
	printf("Please enter the size of a file in megabytes:\n");
	scanf("%f", &MB);
	
	MBs = Mbs / 8;
	printf("At %.2f megabits per second, a file of %.2f megabytes\n"
           "downloads in %.2f seconds.\n", Mbs, MB, MB / MBs);
	
	return 0;
