/* Programming Exercise 6-16 */

/*
    Daphne invests $100 at 10% simple interest. (That is, every year, the investment earns
    an interest equal to 10% of the original investment.) Deridre invests $100 at 5% interest
    compounded annually. (That is, interest is 5% of the current balance, including previous
    addition of interest.) Write a program that finds how many years it takes for the value
    of Deirdre's investment to exceed the value of Daphne's investment. Also show the two
    values at that time.

    It takes 27 years for the value of Deridre's investment to exceed
    the value of Daphne's investment.
    At that time, the value of Daphne's investment is 370.000000,
    and the value of Deridre's investment is 373.345520.
