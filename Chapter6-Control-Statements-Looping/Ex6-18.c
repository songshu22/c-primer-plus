/* Programming Exercise 6-18 */

/*
    Professor Rabnud joined a social media group. Initial he had five friends. He noticed
    that his friend count grew in the following fashion. The first week one friend dropped
    out and the remaining number of friends doubled. The second week two friends dropped
    out and the remaining number of friends doubled. In general, in the Nth week, N friends
    dropped out and the remaining number doubled. Write a program that computes and
    displays the number of friends each week. The program should continue until the count
    exceeds Dunbar's number. Dunbar's number is a rough estimate of the maximum size of
    a cohesive social group in which each member knows every other member and how they
    relate to one another. Its approximate value is 150.
