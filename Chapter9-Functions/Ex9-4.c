/*
    The harmonic mean of two numbers is obtained by taking the inverses of the two
    numbers, averaging them, and taking the inverse of the result. Write a function that
    takes two double arguments and returns the harmonic mean of the two numbers.

    Please enter two numbers: 4 5
    The harmonic mean of 4.000000 and 5.000000 is 4.444444.

    Next two numbers (# to quit): 9 1
    The harmonic mean of 9.000000 and 1.000000 is 1.800000.

    Next two numbers (# to quit): 1 1
    The harmonic mean of 1.000000 and 1.000000 is 1.000000.

    Next two numbers (# to quit): #
    Bye!
